# Custom Function Exploration

## Overview
This project is an exploration of programming concepts through the recreation of built-in functions in JavaScript. The aim is to deepen understanding by dissecting and reconstructing core functionalities found in programming languages.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to delve deeper into programming fundamentals and gain a better understanding of how built-in functions work under the hood. By recreating these functions, we aim to uncover the underlying logic and mechanisms involved, thereby enhancing our programming skills.
